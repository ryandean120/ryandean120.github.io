      <description>When it comes to March Madness this season I truly had no idea what was in store. I knew there were going to be upsets considering no one really played a very complete season, but never as many as there actually were. We had a bunch of Cinderella teams this year and it was amazing to see. After a year of seeing Abilene Christian it was amazing to see them get a win in the tournament.</description>

      <description>If you’ve ever filled out a March Madness bracket, you can truly understand the realest definition of pain, insert Steven A. Smith “Pain” image here.
This year however we are going in with a predictive method as to who is going to win. There is no guarentee that the method will prevail and more likely than not, it won’t. If I were able to perfectly predict every game and happen to win the million dollar prize I WILL be naming a classroom after myself.</description>
