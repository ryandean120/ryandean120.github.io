<p>When it comes to March Madness this season I truly had no idea what was in store. I knew there were going to be upsets considering no one really played a very complete season, but never as many as there actually were. We had a bunch of Cinderella teams this year and it was amazing to see. After a year of seeing Abilene Christian it was amazing to see them get a win in the tournament. In short, I finished in 5th place in our class tournament. My bracket finished in the 89th percentile in the ESPN Tournament Challenge so… I’ll take it.</p>
<p>I was surprised at how well I actually did. My bracket picked Gonzaga to win. If Gonzaga would’ve won I would’ve finished in third place. Ironically I finished in 3rd place anyways. My model started off not so hot in 3 of the 4 regionals. In the West bracket I picked six out of eight correct games, missing on one of many Cinderella teams, Virginia, and missing on a game that never even got played, VCU vs. Oregon. In my East, South and Midwest regionals I predicted 50% of the first round games. Not so good.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised with how well I did. There were a number of decisions made by my model that I definitely didn’t agree with, like the fact that my model was overly confident in the skills of the Cougars of BYU, so confident that they were projected to make it to the Final 4. Another pick I was unhappy with was San Diego State making it to the Final 4, especially since they lost in their first game of the tournament.</p>
<p>Looking back I know that I will not do better than my predictive model. I got cocky in the beginning and Matt can attest to my overconfidence. My bracket that I made for my family was… sub-par and unsuccessful. I have decided that next year I will be taking my talents and my laptop to Vegas and I will come home broke or come how as a millionaire. Hopefully the second one.</p>
