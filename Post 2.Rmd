When it comes to March Madness this season I truly had no idea what was in store. I knew there were going to be upsets considering no one really played a very complete season, but never as many as there actually were. We had a bunch of Cinderella teams this year and it was amazing to see. After a year of seeing Abilene Christian it was amazing to see them get a win in the tournament. In short, I finished in 5th place in our class tournament. My bracket finished in the 89th percentile in the ESPN Tournament Challenge so... I'll take it.
